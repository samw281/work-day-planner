# Work Day Scheduler 

## Purpose
This project is a class assignment in which I was given starter code and tasked to add to it to create a day planner. Functionality I was tasked to add were:
1. Upon opening planner current day displays at the top
2. Below current day are timeblocks for standard business hours
3. Time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether it is in past, present, or future
4. Clicking on the timeblock allows user to enter text
5. Clicking save button will save text to local storage
6. Upon refreshing the page saved text is loaded from local storage
